This is a Database Management System, which has its primary application in the military, acting as a supply tracker and alert notifier.

This project helps keep a track of food, medicine and ammunition in different military regiments.

Nearest regiments with excess/deficient supply are displayed, to facilitate inter-regiment exchanges.

Proper authorization is required to access/edit the information, and details of each such attempt are recorded.
